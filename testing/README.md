# Tutorial

Here we report the procedure to reproduce the results for the test case reported in  [Skinner et al., 'Estimating constraints for protection factors from HDX-MS data' (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2019.02.024).

## Generation of synthetic data

Reference protection factors are in `ref.pfact`. Format: residue ln(pfact)

Assignments for the sequence in `test.seq` are in `test.list`. Format: index start end sequence

To generate reference deuterium uptake (without error):

``` python ../python/pfact2dpred.py --ass test.list --pfact test.pfact --pH 7 --temp 300 --times test.times --seq test.seq --out test ```

The script returns a file `test.Dpred` containing the predicted deuterium uptake. Format: time(hours) D(peptide1) D(peptide2) ... D(peptideN)

Please rename the file `test.Dpred` as `test.Dexp`:
* `mv test.Dpred test.Dexp` if you use Linux
* `REN test.Dpred test.Dexp` if you use Windows

## Predict protection factors from synthetic data

To find a solution, i.e. a pattern of protection factors, which accurately fits the data, ExPfact performs a random search followed by a least-squares minimization.
The random search consists in i) randomly initializing `--rand` sets of protection factors with the constraint `0<ln(Pfact)<=20`, ii) calculate the cost function (sum of squared residuals) for each set, and iii) select the set with lowest cost function.
The selected pattern of protection factors is used as initial guess for the minimization. 

To calculate one solution:

` python ../python/exPfact.py --temp 300 --pH 7.0 --dexp test.Dexp --ass test.list --weights test.weights --harm 0 --rand 10000 --seq test.seq --out out `

Parameters:
* `--temp 300`: temperature of the experiment in K 
* `--pH 7`: pH of the experiment; please insert the corrected `pH = pHread + 0.4` 
* `--dexp test.Dexp`: file containing the experimental deuterium uptake for all peptide at all time points
* `--ass test.list`: peptide assignments
* `--weights test.weights`: weights to be assigned to each measure. For synthetic data with no error, these weights are irrelevant (all set to 1). If available, use the invere of the standard deviation on measured deuterium uptake. 
* `--harm 0`: if different from 0, it introduces a penalty term to the cost function (see below)
* `--rand 10000`: number of random sets of protection factors in the random search.
* `--seq test.seq`: file containing the sequence of the protein.
* `--out out`: name used for output files

The script generates three output files:
* `out.pfact`: the predicted pattern of protection factors. 
* `out.Dpred`: the predicted deuterium uptake.
* `out.diff`: sum of squared residuals between predicted and experimental uptake for each peptide.

In the case of synthetic data, the predicted deuterium uptake contained in the file `out.Dpred` should be almost identical to the experimental values `test.Dexp`.
However, the predicted protection factors `out.pfact` could be different from the reference `test.pfact` because of underdetermination. 
The sum of squared residuals should approach zero for all peptides in the file `out.diff`.

## Producing multiple solutions

To generate multiple solutions, just add the parameter `--rep` to the previous command.
To produce 100 predictions of protection factors, all with similar agreement with protection factors:

` python ../python/exPfact.py --temp 300 --pH 7.0 --dexp test.Dexp --ass test.list --weights test.weights --harm 0 --rand 10000 --seq test.seq --out out --rep 100`

Variability in the prediction for specific residues provides a measure of the underdetermination of the problem. 
Use different assignment sets to see how the overlap of assigned peptides affect the quality of the prediction.

Similarly to the case of a single solution, three outputs are generated, namely `out[i].pfact`, `out[i].Dpred` and `out[i].diff`, where `[i]` identifies the i-th solution.

## Descriptive statistics

To analyse the outcomes of multiple minimization calculating average, median, minimum/maximum values, digit: 

` python ../python/descriptive.py --res out --top 50 `

Parameters:
* `--res`: prefix of resutls to be analysed (equivalent to the paramter `--out` in the command to generate multiple solutions). E.g.: if outputs out1.pfact, ..., out100.pfact have been previously generated, use `--res out`
* `--top`: percentage of best solutions to be generated (default 50%)

Outputs:
* `average.pfact`: contains the average protection factor per residue with associated standard deviation. Format: residue average(lnP) std
* `median.pfact`: contains the median protection factor per residue. Format: residue median(lnP)
* `minmax.pfact`: contains the minimum and maximum value assumed by the protection factor. Format: residue min(lnP) max(lnP)
* `all.sp`: contains all the protection factors estimated by the best `--top` runs. Format:

|       | Residue 1 | Residue 2 | ... | Residue N |
| ----- | --------- | --------- | --- | --------- |
| Run 1 | lnP(1,1)  | lnP(1,2)  | ... | lnP(1,N)  |
| Run 2 | lnP(2,1)  | lnP(2,2)  | ... | lnP(2,N)  |
|  ...  |    ...    |    ...    | ... |    ...    |

Each column in the file `all.sp` can be used to build the histogram of protection factors predicted for a specific residue. 

## Clustering algorithm

The clustering algorithm is applied to the results in the file `all.sp` previously generated. 

The clustering algorithm is based on Gaussian mixture models. 
Regions covered by contiguous overlapping peptides are considered one at a time. 
The histograms of the protection factors of every residue in this region are combined into a multi-dimensional probability distribution. 
The probability distribution is fitted with a mixture of gaussians with number of components varying from 1 to 99. 
The final number of components is decided based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). 

To run the clustering algorithm: 

``` python ../python/clustering.py --ass test.ass ```

**Note**: if not done previously, run R interactively and install the mclust package: `install.packages("mclust")`

Outputs: for an area covered by overlapping peptides starting at residue `i` and ending at residue `j`, the following output files are generated:

* `i-j.mclust` contains the mean and variance of the protection factor of each residue for every component. The output file consists of three columns (`%residue %pfact %variance`). Components are separated by a line containing the symbol `&`.
* `i-j.mod` contains the mean of the protection factor of each residue for every component. Every column is a pattern of protection factors, every row represents an amino acid. 
* `i-j.var` contains the variances of the protection factor of each residue for every component (same format as `i-j.mod`).
* `i-j.pro` contains the probability assigned to each component. The output consists of two columns: the first is the component index, the second is the probability assigned to that specific component. Components are sorted from the most to the least probable. 
* `i-j.bic` contains the BIC scores for number of components ranging 1 to 99.

## Predicting the shape of the isotopic envelope

The shape of the isotopic envelope of a peptide can be predicted from a set of protection factors if a multinomial probability distribution is convoluted with the fully protonated isotopic envelope.

The fully protonated isotopic envelope can be calculated as the convolution of the monoisotopic mass of the peptides with the natural abundance of elements. Given the sequence and the charge state of the peptide, the protonated envelope can be calculated using the `pyopenms` library:

``` python ../python/Hisotope.py --seq <sequence> --z <charge state> ```

The script generates a file `<sequence>.txt` containing the fully protonated envelope of a peptide with sequence `<sequence>` and charge state `<charge state>`. Alternatively, the same envelope can be obtained using online tools like [MS-Isotope](http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/cgi-bin/msform.cgi?form=msisotope).

To predict the shape of the isotopic envelope at given exchange times, 

``` python ../python/isenv.py --mode p --ass test.ass --seq test.seq --T_label 300 --pH_label 7 --pfact test.pfact --times test.times --pep 2 --z 1 --prefix iso ```

The mode `p` stands for "predict" and only performs a prediction of the isotopic envelope (no comparison with experimental data). The isotopic envelope is predicted for peptide with index `--pep` from the assignment file `--ass`. The sequence of the protein (`--seq`), the temperature and pH of the label buffer (`--T_label`,`--pH_label`) are required to calculate intrinsic exchange rates; a pattern of protection factors (`--pfact`) is required. The isotopic envelope is predicted for every time contained in the file specified in `--times` for charge state `--z`. The results are saved in a folder named `--prefix`.

## Adding a penalization term to the cost function

In order to avoid overfitting and encourage the finding of solutions with no abrupt changes between protection factors of adjacent residues (unless guided by experimental data), 
a penalty term can be added to the cost function using the parameter `--harm`.
To choose the best value for the penalty costnant (i.e., the value of `--harm`), leave-one-out cross validation can be performed:

`python ../python/cross_validation.py --dexp test.Dexp --ass test.ass --temp 300 --pH 7.0 --seq test.seq`

The script returs a file `CV.res` containing the train and test cross-validation error (CVE) calculated at different values of `--harm`. Format: harm CVE_train CVE_test. Select the `--harm` value that minimizes the total cross validation error (CVE_train+CVE_test).
